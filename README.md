# Exam Challenges and AI Assistance

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

During this exam, I encountered several challenges that required careful problem-solving:

1. **Task 3 Implementation Difficulties**: I struggled significantly with Task 3, which required implementing the Online Store Management System (OSMS).

2. **Documentation Format**: Creating proper documentation in the ms.md file was challenging as I needed to follow a specific format similar to the provided sample document.

3. **Adding New Features**: Understanding how to implement and properly document the new savings tracking feature required deep understanding of the system's architecture.

## AI Tool Usage and Benefits

AI tools were extremely helpful during this exam, particularly for Task 3:

1. **Task 3 - Online Store Management System**: 
   - AI provided substantial help with understanding and implementing the OSMS system.
   - It helped me understand the relationships between Product, Customer, and OSMS classes.
   - The AI explanations clarified how to implement discount calculations and customer purchase tracking.

2. **Documentation Creation**:
   - AI was essential in helping me write the ms.md file with the proper format and structure.
   - It helped me understand how to document the classes, methods, and features effectively.

3. **Javadoc Implementation**:
   - AI assisted me in writing proper Javadoc comments for classes and methods.
   - It showed me how to format comment blocks to identify the new feature implementation.

Through AI assistance, I gained a better understanding of Java constructs that were new to me, particularly around object relationships and feature implementation in the OSMS system.

## Cases Where AI Was Not Helpful

Despite its benefits, AI couldn't help with everything:

1. **Task 1 Challenges**: I tried using AI to help with Task 1, but it didn't provide useful solutions. The responses weren't relevant to the specific requirements of the task, and I had to solve it through other means.

2. **Specific Implementation Details**: Sometimes the AI provided generic solutions that needed significant modification to work with my specific code structure.

3. **Debugging Issues**: When facing errors during testing, AI suggestions sometimes didn't address the actual problems in my implementation.

Overall, while AI was incredibly helpful for Task 3, particularly with creating the ms.md documentation and understanding Java concepts, it had limitations when dealing with Task 1 requirements and some specific implementation challenges.
